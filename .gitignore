# Git "allowlist" pattern - ignore everything by default
# This .gitignore is configured to track ONLY the files you explicitly allow

# First, ignore all files with *
*
# Explicitly ignore all directories with */ to ensure files in subdirectories
# are not matched
# */
# Unignore just the top-level README.md
!README.md
# Also track the .gitignore file itself
!.gitignore

# Then, add exceptions (files/directories you want to track) using ! prefix
# Examples:
# !.gitignore             # Track the .gitignore file itself
# !README.md              # Track specific files
# !src/                   # Track the src directory
# !src/**                 # Track everything inside src directory
# !*.py                   # Track all Python files
# !Makefile               # Track Makefile

# Uncomment the lines below to track specific files/directories
# !.gitignore               # Track this .gitignore file

# Even if you un-ignore a directory, you still need to un-ignore its contents
# For example, to track everything in a "src" directory:
# !src/
# !src/**

!AI/
!AI/**
!git/
!git/git-diff.md
!git/remote-repo.md
!taigi/
!taigi/**
