Since you already know Vim basics, here are the most impactful things to learn:

1. Master Telescope (your superpower):
    *  <Space>sf to find any file instantly
    *  <Space>sg to search text across your entire project
2. Get comfortable with LSP:
    *  gd to jump to definitions
    *  K to see documentation
    *  grn to rename variables
3. Learn the text objects from mini.ai:
    *  vaq - select around quotes
    *  cib - change inside brackets

Would you like me to:
•  Show you specific keybindings for any of these plugins?
•  Demonstrate how to add your first custom plugin?
•  Walk through a typical workflow using your current setup?

Your configuration is already very capable - you have essentially everything you need for productive coding!
